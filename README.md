# PracAI

PracAI is a web application designed to support psychology research and training.  
This repository contains my independent extensions and contributions to the project.

## üîç Background
The original project was developed in collaboration with the **UF Psychology Lab**.  
It started as a private repository maintained by lab members.  
This repository (`bwang0403/PracAI`) contains my own work, refactoring, and new features.
